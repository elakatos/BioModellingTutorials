    "This model aims to capture the dynamics of mismatch repair (MMR) deficient crypts/cells appearing in the healthy colon of Lynch syndrome individuals. In Lynch syndrome, due to an inherited mutation in an MMR gene, complete loss of MMR only requires a single hit and therefore this is a way more likely event than in other individuals. Here we study what are the dynamics of MMRd (mutant) crypts/cells and their expected proportion in the colon.\n",
